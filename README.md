## About project
This project has 2 main apps: BubbleSort and BalancedWordCounter. Each of these had to be tested via specified cases which they are included in their classes.
1) BubbleSort

Task content: 
Create a “BubbleSort” class with one public method called “sort” which has to sort numbers in accordance with the “Bubble sort” algorithm. 
Method should receive List of Comparable (parameter name = “input”), method should return List of Comparable, but the numbers should be sorted ascending if the input is null then method should throw an exception, 
if the input contains null value in list then method should omit this element.

2) BalancedWordCounter

Task content: 
Create a “BalancedWordsCounter” class with one public method called “count” which has to count how many balanced subwords exist in the input word. 
Method should receive String (parameter name = “input”) method should return Integer the input should contain the letters only, throw an exception if the text contains other characters, 
if the input is null then method should throw an exception. The word is balanced if every letter that occurs in it occurs in the same number of time. 
E.g. the words: “mama”, “ear”, “aabbcbcccbaa” are balanced, 
but the words “dad”, “elephant”, “abcba” are not. 
Additionally, the balanced word is not empty.

## What skills were tested?
Mainly Java skills was proven in these apps. Additionally the 'BubbleSort' app was tested in JUnit but the 'BalancedWordCounter' app was tested via normal-driver class.
